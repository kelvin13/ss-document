# ``DOM``

This module defines the basic infrastructure common to all DOM encoding interfaces.

**You should not import this module directly**; it is not very useful on its own, and this is by
design. Instead, you should import ``/HTML``, which re-exports this module, and adds useful APIs
to its types through extensions.
